# Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Samples

Welcome to the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Samples repository! 

> [!CAUTION]
> The examples provided in this repository are for experimental and educational purposes only. They demonstrate concepts and techniques but are not intended for direct use in production environments. Make sure to have Amazon Bedrock Guardrails in place to protect against [prompt injection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-injection.html). 

**Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** is a complete set of capabilities to deploy and operate agents securely, at scale using any agentic framework and any LLM model. 
With it, developers can accelerate AI agents into production quickly, accelerating the business value timelines. 

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides tools and capabilities to make agents more effective and capable, purpose-built infrastructure to securely scale agents, and 
controls to operate trustworthy agents. 

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore capabilities are composable and work with popular open-source frameworks and any model, so you don‚Äôt have to choose between 
open-source flexibility and enterprise-grade security and reliability.

This collection provides examples and tutorials to help you understand, implement, and integrate Amazon Bedrock AgentCore capabilities into your applications.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### üìö [`01-tutorials/`](./01-tutorials/)
**Interactive Learning & Foundation**

This folder contains notebook-based tutorials that teach you the fundamentals of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore capabilities through hands-on examples.

The structure is divided by AgentCore component:
* **Runtime**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime is a secure, serverless runtime capability that empowers organizations to deploy and scale both AI agents and tools, regardless of framework, protocol, or model choice‚Äîenabling rapid prototyping, seamless scaling, and accelerated time to market
* **Gateway**: AI agents need tools to perform real-world tasks‚Äîfrom searching databases to sending messages. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway automatically converts APIs, Lambda functions, and existing services into MCP-compatible tools so developers can quickly make these essential capabilities available to agents without managing integrations. 
* **Memory**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory makes it easy for developer to build rich, personalized agent experiences with fully-manged memory infrastructure and the ability to customize memory for your needs.
* **Identity**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity provides seamless agent identity and access management across AWS services and third-party applications such as Slack and Zoom while supporting any standard identity providers such as Okta, Entra, and Amazon Cognito.
* **Tools**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides two built-in tools to simplify your agentic AI application development: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore **Code Interpreter** tool enables AI agents to write and execute code securely, enhancing their accuracy and expanding their ability to solve complex end-to-end tasks. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore **Browser Tool** is an enterprise-grade capability that enables AI agents to navigate websites, complete multi-step forms, and perform complex web-based tasks with human-like precision within a fully managed, secure sandbox environment with low latency
* **Observability**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Observability helps developers trace, debug, and monitor agent performance through unified operational dashboards. With support for OpenTelemetry compatible telemetry and detailed visualizations of each step of the agent workflow, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Observability enables developers to easily gain visibility into agent behavior and maintain quality standards at scale.



The **end-to-end example** folder provide a simple example of how to combine the different capabilities
on a use case.

The examples provided as perfect for beginners and those looking to understand the underlying concepts before building AI Agents applications.

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore with different entry points.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples.git
   ```

You will need to install the pre-requisites for deploying your agent into AgentCore Runtime. Follow the instructions below to get your environment up and running:

1. Install Docker or Finch. You can get started [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
1. Make sure that you Docker or Finch is running
1. For better package control it is strongly recommended that you create a virtual environment to run your applications. `uv` tool is a high-speed package and project manager for Python. We recommend using `uv` to manager your environment here. You can install uv with the instructions from [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
1. Once you have `uv` installed, create and activate a new environment using the following commands:
```commandline
uv python install 3.10
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv init
```
Next add the required packages to your `uv` environment:
```commandline
uv add -r requirements.txt --active
```
You can start a Jupyter notebook instance from your `uv` environment using:
```commandline
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
```
